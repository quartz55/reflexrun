### HOW TO GET STARTED

* ##### Installing the HUD/Mode

  To *install* Reflexrun, just extract the contents of the zip into a folder called "reflexrunHUD" in the Reflex “ui” folder.
  
  It will look somewhat like this: **Reflexfps -> base -> internal -> ui -> reflexrunHUD**

* ##### Play Reflexrun!

  If you want to record / practice locally you can do so by typing `map RRmapname`
into the console to load it.
Reflexrun Maps always start with *“RR”*.
Load the Hud / mode with the console command
`ui_show_widget reflexrun`
